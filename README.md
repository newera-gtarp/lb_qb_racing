# LB Phone App for QB Lapraces (Ported NPWD app)

> Make sure to have the newest version of `qb-lapraces`.

## Install instructions
1. Download latest release zip
2. Export the lb_qb_racing folder and drag it into your resources folder.
3. Start resource. App should automatically be available in LB Phone without any further configuration.

## Additional Notes
I am not able to actively maintain this fork or keep it caught up with upstream changes. This is intended as a proof of concept for porting NPWD apps to LB Phone.
